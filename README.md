# Analyzing Amazon Customer Behavior: Trends in Shopping & Cart Abandonment

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes the Kaggle Amazon consumer behavior dataset from **[Swathi Menon](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swathiunnikrishnan/amazon-consumer-behaviour-dataset)**. The goal was to gain insights into customer behavior when shopping, uncover trends that lead to incomplete transactions, relationships among genders and age ranges that influence shopping, and provide actionable insights. These insights could be used to optimize advertising and app features to reduce cart abandonment and increase completed transactions on Amazon.

**Note:** This project was completed using **Excel** for data cleaning and manipulation and **Power BI** for creating visualizations. Due to limited access to Power BI Pro, the interactive dashboard cannot be shared. However, screenshots of the dashboard are provided below to offer a visual overview of the analysis.

### Key Insights

#### Insights on Amazon Shopper Behavior: Reducing Cart Abandonment

**Key Findings:**
- **Highest Cart Abandonment:** 18-35-year-old females are the most likely to abandon carts, driven by indecisiveness and seeking better deals elsewhere.
- **Key Categories:** Beauty and clothing are the most popular categories for this demographic.
- **Effective Methods:** Optimizing categories and keywords is the most successful way to guide users towards completing purchases.

**Actionable Insights:**
1. **Targeting Price-Sensitive Shoppers (18-35 Female)**  
   - **Discounts & Price Matching:** Offer exclusive discounts or price-match guarantees to capture sales before customers find better prices elsewhere.
   - **Urgency Tactics:** Use countdown timers or limited-time offers to create urgency, reducing decision-making time (e.g., Temu, Shein).
   
2. **Optimize Categories & Keywords**  
   - **SEO & Product Descriptions:** Ensure product descriptions and categories are optimized for search, making it easier for users to find what theyâ€™re looking for.
   - **Clear Site Navigation:** Organize categories like beauty, personal care, and clothing to streamline the shopping experience.
   
3. **Personalized Recommendations**  
   - **Category-Based Suggestions:** Tailor recommendations based on users' browsing and purchase history, focusing on beauty and fashion to increase cross-selling and upselling.
   
4. **Build Trust for Price Comparisons**  
   - **Transparent Pricing:** Include reviews and price comparison tools to demonstrate competitive pricing, which increases consumer confidence and reduces cart abandonment.

### Methods

#### Data Cleaning (Excel)
âœ” Removed duplicates and missing values from the dataset.  
âœ” Applied data transformations (e.g., standardizing formats, grouping data).  
âœ” Checked for anomalies or outliers that could skew the analysis.

---

### Visualizations (Power BI)  
ðŸ“Œ **Heatmap of Purchase Categories Across Genders** â€“ Displays the most common purchase categories among genders.  
ðŸ“Œ **Pie Chart of Search Methods that Lead to Cart Completion** â€“ Displays a percentage breakdown of the main search methods that lead to a purchase.  
ðŸ“Œ **Stacked Bar Chart of Cart Abandonment Factors by Gender and Age Range** â€“ Displays factors leading to cart abandonment by gender and age range from 18 to 65.

### Limitations
The dataset used in this project was heavily skewed towards the female demographic and individuals under 34 years of age. This could be due to biased sampling or the fact that younger individuals and females are more likely to respond to surveys. As a result, insights for people outside this demographic are limited. Additionally, the categorical breakdown used in the dataset has an extensive number of combinations, which results in some rows of the heatmap being empty.

### Next Steps
Based on the findings from this analysis, further research can be conducted for the non-18-35 female demographic to understand factors influencing cart completion. Expanding the dataset to include more male respondents and individuals over 55 would be valuable, though it may be challenging due to potential unfamiliarity with technology among older users.
